The basic premise of the integral is to calculate area under any function (f(x)) given on the interval [a,b] 
The idea of the Riemann integral is to use shape approximations for the area under f(x).
However, it becomes very tedious writing out the entire solution to approximating simple integrals using the Riemann Sum, especially if you want to use several partitions to recieve an accurate approximation to the true answer.
Here's code in Python on how to avoid all the mathematical arithmetic and receive the mere answer.
